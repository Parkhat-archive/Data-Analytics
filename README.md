Questions: 
1. Is hotel revenue growing by year?
2. Should we increase parking lot size?

Results:
1. The hotel revenue is growing by year.
2. Parking lot size does not require size increase.
3.  Third and fourth quarter of the year was more profitable in years 2018 and 2019, 
yet the 2020 did not show such trend, possibly due to the global pandemic.
